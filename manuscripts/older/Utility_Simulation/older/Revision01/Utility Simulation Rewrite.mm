Methods for mapping between categories are required to allow these different sources of evidence to be used. Using stroke as a case study, this paper describes a method for mapping HRQoL from more (seven) to fewer (three or four) categories in a way which does not underrepresent the additional uncertainty involved in this indirect use of evidence.

      <b>Methods:</b>&#160;An informal Bayesian simulation approach was used to estimate, with credible intervals (CrIs), the estimated mean HRQoLs of patients in each of three discrete states (dead, dependent stroke, independent stroke), given summary data reported for each of seven discrete states. The approach incorporates the known uncertainty about both the expected HRQoL in each of the seven states and known uncertainty about the proportion of patients in each of the seven categories. The three-state estimates produced were compared with older estimates to assess face validity.

      The method described was developed when constructing a model of the consequences of prescribing oral anticoagulants (OACs) in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). (3,4)&#160;OACs reduce stroke risk but can lead to intracranial haemorrhages (ICHs) which can cause brain injury. Like strokes, ICHs can be fatal, and cause qualitatively similar kinds of disablement and quality of life impairment. The management of AF therefore involves balancing the costs and consequences of prescribing compared with not prescribing an OAC. <a>

      In each of the examples presented in this paper, different categorisation assumptions were made about how each of the mRS categories mapped onto a smaller number of categories. The mappings used are shown in Table 2. For the first example, we assumed that an independent stroke outcome corresponds to an mRS state 0, 1 or 2, and that a dependent stroke outcome corresponds to an mRS state 3, 4, and 5. Death is mRS state 6, and was assumed throughout to have a utility value of 0.

      In the second example, we looked at the verbal descriptions of each of the mRS states, and each of the GOS states, and from this made the assumption that GOS 5 (&#8216;good recovery&#8217;) corresponds to mRS states 0 or 1, that GOS 4 (&#8216;moderately disabled&#8217;) corresponds to mRS states 2 or 3, and that GOS 3 (&#8216;severely disabled&#8217;) corresponds to mRS states 4 or 5. GOS 2 (&#8216;persistent vegetative state&#8217;) was assumed to have no utility, and so correspond, alongside GOS 1 (&#8216;dead&#8217;) with mRS 6 (&#8216;dead&#8217;).

      The proportions in each of the mRS states at 24 months, which was assumed to be the long-term outcome, were simulated in a two-stage process using data from the source paper. In the first stage (Node 1 in both Figure 1&#160;and Figure 2) the proportion that dies as a result of suffering a stroke is first simulated using a binomial distribution. In the second stage (Node 2a in both Figure 1&#160;and Figure 2), the distribution of those alive in each of the six living mRS states (mRS categories 0 to 5) was simulated using a Dirichlet distribution using cell counts from the source paper at 24 months as input parameters. These simulated proportions were then stored for later use (Node 3a in both Figure 1&#160;and Figure 2).

      Having made this assumption, the effect of different degrees of severity of stroke on HRQoL can be estimated by comparing HRQoL in higher mRS states with the HRQoL in the baseline state (mRS 0). Either an additive or a multiplicative approach could be used for this comparison. In the additive approach, the HRQoL estimates from more severe states are subtracted from the baseline state, to produce <i>utility decrements </i>associated the clinical event. In the multiplicative approach, the HRQoL in more severe states was divided by that in the baseline state to produce <i><a>utility multipliers</a></i><a>. </a><a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_19" href="#_msocom_19" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_19')" name="_msoanchor_19" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_19','_com_19')">[j19]</a>

      The multiplicative approach was used in this paper, and so utility multipliers were produced by dividing estimates of the HRQoL in more severe states by HRQoL estimates in the mRS 0 state. The effect of making the additive assumption instead could be explored in further research.

      The weighted utility multipliers were based on predicted values from the component distributions (mRS 0, mRS 1 and so on), whereas modellers are typically interested in using expected values, i.e. distributions representing uncertainty in the mean values. To produce estimates of the expected values, a bootstrapping procedure was used, in which the distribution of predicted values was resampled with replacement 10,000 times to produce 10,000 simulated datasets, and the mean values of each of these datasets recorded to produce a distribution of expected values.

      Table 4&#160;below shows the mean simulated proportions in the dead, independent and dependent stroke state, together with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) as well as mean simulated utility multipliers associated with each of the states, also with 95% CrIs. The simulation suggests that approximately one quarter of patients die as a result of a stroke, around one fifth are left in a dependent state, and the remainder are left in an independent state. Being in a dependent state leads, on average, to slightly more than a halving of the patient&#8217;s quality of life, whereas being in an independent state leads to quality of life reducing by around one fifth compared with patients whose strokes had no lasting effect (mRS 0).

      For our first example, our estimated utility multipliers are very similar to those presented in Dorman et al.,(12)&#160;for independent strokes but somewhat higher than those reported in that paper for dependent strokes. This is largely due to the distribution of mRS states within the Independent Stroke and Dependent Stroke categories, which for both categories of stroke are weighted towards less severe mRS states. In the case of dependent strokes (mRS 3-5), for example, only around 4% were the worst category (mRS 5), which has an estimated EQ-5D multiplier near zero, while three-quarters were in the least worst category (mRS 3), which has an estimated EQ-5D multiplier over 0.5.

      The approach described here is designed to allow better use of existing summary data, in the absence of true individual level data. It does this by creating hypothetical individual level data as an intermediate stage. The approach is necessarily limited by the need to make assumptions about the statistical relationship between the summary data available and the individual level data. For <a>example, we assumed that the mean EQ-5D estimates for each mRS followed a normal distribution, </a><a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_41" href="#_msocom_41" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_41')" name="_msoanchor_41" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_41','_com_41')">[j41]</a>&#160;which is bounded between negative and positive infinity. EQ-5D utility scores show a negative lower bound whose value depends on the valuation tariff used and an upper ceiling (1.00) by construction, and so a statistical distribution where these bounds are applied may be more appropriate. We also know that EQ-5D data are only poorly approximated by the normal distribution, as the distribution of EQ-5D is typically known to be &#8216;multimodal&#8217;. <a>This represents a more general limitation common to a range of modelling approaches, </a>(13)&#160;rather than something specific to this approach. <a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_42" href="#_msocom_42" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_42')" name="_msoanchor_42" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_42','_com_42')">[j42]</a>

      Without access to the individual level data the appropriateness of the statistical assumptions made, such as the choice of stochastic distributions, cannot be assessed. The dependence of the reconstructed summary estimates on the choice of statistical distributions can be assessed, however, by using different statistical models and comparing the results. <a>As the R code is presented in the online appendix, it is convenient for readers to assess the dependence of the estimates on modelling assumptions themselves, and assess the impact of alternative choices of statistical distributions which use the same summary data. </a><a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_43" href="#_msocom_43" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_43')" name="_msoanchor_43" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_43','_com_43')">[j43]</a>

      In addition to assumptions about the choice of statistical distribution, this method involves making two further types of qualitative assumption. Firstly, we made the <a>assumption of perfect mapping </a><a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_44" href="#_msocom_44" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_44')" name="_msoanchor_44" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_44','_com_44')">[j44]</a>&#160;(&#8216;deterministic <a>bijection</a><a language="JavaScript" id="_anchor_45" href="#_msocom_45" class="msocomanchor" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_45')" name="_msoanchor_45" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_45','_com_45')">[j45]</a>&#160;&#8217;) between health states based on descriptions of states. Secondly, we made the assumption in the second example that a persistent vegetative state has mean utility equal to death, whereas it may be that the utility associated with this state is different to this, and possibly negative (&#8216;worse than death&#8217;).

      The first type of assumption, the perfect mapping, should represent the best assumption of the economic modeller based on clinical knowledge.

      A further assumption made was that the 24 month state reported in the Rivero-Arias paper was the patient&#8217;s permanent state, and the patients for whom mRS outcomes were reported were assumed to be representative of those for whom the data were not collected.

      The comparison with the estimates reported in Dornan et al (12)&#160;revealed differences in estimates which appear clinically plausible and to reflect improvements in stroke care which have occurred over the two decades that separate the results used by Dornan et al from those from OXVASC. As such it appears that the method described here was able to provide updated estimates of the HRQoL effects of suffering either a dependent or independent stroke. The higher HRQoL estimates for dependent strokes produced by this method, which is based on much more recent data, may therefore be more appropriate than previous estimates for use in contemporary health economic modelling.

Typically but not always, outcome values associated with these states include health related quality of life (HRQoL), future event risks, and event costs from the perspective of the healthcare provider. The method allows sources of data which report the outcome values by categories which are not the same as the economic model&apos;s health states to be used to parameterise the models. Using such data introduces additional sources of uncertainty in the true outcome values associated with the model&apos;s health states. The approach described here accounts for these additional uncertainties, leading to wider credible intervals in the model outcome value estimates. To not incorporate these additional uncertainties is likely to underplay the level of parameter uncertainty and potentially decision uncertainty relating to the economic model and its interpretation.

The specific technology under evaluation was transthoracic echocardiography, an imaging technology which can help identify a subgroup of AF patients with a particularly high risk of stroke, so that they can be prescribed oral anticoagulants (OACs) to reduce stroke risk at an earlier stage. The model comprises a short-term diagnostic stage, in which an initial population of AF patients is divided into four diagnostic subgroups: false positives, false negatives, true positives and true negatives; the first two categories are forms of incorrect diagnoses, and the latter two are forms of correct diagnoses. Each type of correct and incorrect diagnosis has a different long-term consequence to the healthcare provider (cost) and the patient (health), and so the long-term consequences for each of the four subgroups needed to be estimated in order for the downstream effects of the diagnostic technology to be evaluated.

Some proportion of major haemorrhages are categorised as intracranial, and a proportion of these intracranial haemorrhages can cause permanent brain damage, which can be as disabling in their effects as the strokes which OACs are taken in order to prevent. Modelling the long-term consequences of taking OACs, and the avoidable risks which result from a false positive diagnosis, therefore needs the consequences of OAC-induced haemorrhage to be modelled appropriately.

HRQoL was also allowed to vary with age and gender, using estimates from X&amp;Y. [REF] Additionally, the model allowed patients to experience multiple clinical events, such as a stroke then later an intracranial haemorrhage, each at different ages. Because of this, HRQoL multipliers rather than HRQoL decrements were applied when an event occurred, as they allow some adjustment of HRQoL event penalties to account for age, gender and clinical background. A multiplier will also never lead a a negative HRQoL estimate, which is likely to be inappropriate for most conditions.  "/>

In the model these outcome values included health consequences (the HRQoL multiplier), and event costs, in addition to event risk multipliers such as changes in the risk of stroke as a result of using an OAC. Both health effects and costs are divided into instantaneous effects, which are applied at the time of the event, and ongoing effects, which continue either until the next event and/or death. Additionally,there needs to be a range of estimates for each output value in order to appropriately represent uncertainty as part of probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). "/>

For this reason, the model used these two stroke categories. By contrast, two sources of estimates were identified for the HRQoL effects of stroke: estimates from a relatively old study, in which HRQoL was reported separately for dependent and independent level stroke; and estimates from a newer study, in which HRQoL was reported by modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a clinical scale with six discrete levels (mRS levels 0 to 5). By convention, mRS levels 0 to 2 correspond to an independent stroke, and levels 3 to 5 to a dependent stroke. "/>

The newer estimates were considered preferable because it was believed that the older estimates would not be representative of current health outcomes following stroke, which are likely to have improved due to improvements in stroke management. [REFs?] However, using the newer data, presented at a different level of disaggregation involves mapping from the more to the less disaggregated number of states. Doing this in a way which appropriately accounts for the additional uncertainty introduced from mapping is the primary purpose of the approach. "/>

By making use of the estimates from Rivero-Arias again, estimates for both the HRQoL impairments of strokes and ICHs are based on the same patient population. Treatment with OACs reduces the risk of the former but increases the risk of the latter, and so using data from the same population for estimates of the HRQoL consequences of both event types means differences between estimates between event types will not be an artefact of differences in the patient population.

The estimated multipliers are very similar to those presented in Dornan et al.,(12)&#xa0;for independent strokes but somewhat higher than those reported in that paper for dependent strokes. This is largely due to the distribution of mRS states within the Independent Stroke and Dependent Stroke categories, which for both categories of stroke are weighted towards less severe mRS states. In the case of dependent strokes (mRS 3-5), for example, only around 4% were the worst category (mRS 5), which has an estimated EQ-5D multiplier near zero, while three-quarters were in the least worst category (mRS 3), which has an estimated EQ-5D multiplier over 0.5. Such a finding could be explained by assuming that patient outcomes following stroke have improved due to better short term treatment and intervention. This highlights the importance of making use of more recent data where possible, given that healthcare systems change and improve. To do otherwise may be to misrepresent the costs and clinical consequences of modern treatment regimens for particular conditions. [j40]"/>

The &apos;posterior&apos; distributions are produced by sampling from the &apos;prior&apos; distributions a large but pre-determined number of time. However, the approach is not fully Bayesian in that estimates of the parameters are not themselves updated using, for example, a Gibbs sampling process applied repeatedly following structural specification of the model. The comparatively quick-and-dirty approach used here has the advantage of simplicity, but a more formal treatment of the estimation of parameters may be preferable in some contexts. "/>

However a formal comparison and synthesis of results produced by different mapping assumptions has not been undertaken. Estimates resulting from different mapping assumptions could be combined using a meta-model framework, in which results are weighted by, for example, results from expert elicitation">

The draw sizes considered ranged from 10^1 to 10^7, increasing in multiples of 10. These values were used because it was assumed before the simulation that marginal improvements in estimate accuracy will decrease exponentially, but computing time will increase linearly, with changes in sample size. Only by using a wide range of sample size value can this prior assumption be tested.">
